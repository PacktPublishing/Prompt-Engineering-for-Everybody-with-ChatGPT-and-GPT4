Question 1: How can you control the length of the output generated by an AI model?
a) By adjusting the temperature of the AI system
b) By explicitly mentioning the desired length in the prompt
c) By using chain-of-thought prompting
d) By adjusting the maximum number of words or characters in the prompt

Answer: d) By adjusting the maximum number of words or characters in the prompt

Question 2: What effect does increasing the "temperature" of an AI system have on its output?
a) It produces more focused and conservative responses
b) It generates more diverse and creative outputs
c) It shortens the output
d) It improves the AI's understanding of context

Answer: b) It generates more diverse and creative outputs

Question 3: In which scenario is chain-of-thought prompting particularly useful?
a) When the topic is simple and requires a short answer
b) When the AI needs additional context to provide a relevant response
c) When the AI is generating captions for images
d) When the AI is used for language detection

Answer: b) When the AI needs additional context to provide a relevant response

Question 4: What is the primary purpose of multimodal AI systems?
a) To generate more creative text
b) To improve the AI's understanding of context
c) To work with different types of data, such as images and audio
d) To control the length of the output

Answer: c) To work with different types of data, such as images and audio

Question 5: Which of the following strategies can help manage the non-deterministic nature of AI systems?
a) Test multiple prompt variations to find the most reliable and consistent results
b) Use chain-of-thought prompting for all tasks
c) Increase the temperature of the AI system
d) Focus solely on the AI's strengths and ignore its limitations

Answer: a) Test multiple prompt variations to find the most reliable and consistent results
